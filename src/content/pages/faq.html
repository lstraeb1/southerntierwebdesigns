                        <p class="cs-item-p">Our service includes full website design and development, mobile responsiveness, on-page SEO, hosting, ongoing edits, and personal support. We act as your website partner, not just a designer. We also include regular site updates, analytics integration, and performance optimization.</p>

                        <p class="cs-item-p">Our service is designed for small to mid-sized businesses that want a professional online presence without the hassle of managing the technical side. Whether you're a local contractor, medical office, or service-based company, we offer fast turnaround and tailored support to help your business grow.</p>

                        <p class="cs-item-p">We write all content for you unless you prefer to provide it. Our team will request some basic info about your business, services, and goals. From there, we handle the writing, formatting, and layout to ensure it's SEO-friendly and aligned with your voice.</p>

                        <p class="cs-item-p">Most web designers either charge a high upfront fee or build cookie-cutter sites using bloated page builders. What's worse is that they tend to go missing after development is complete. We strive for partnership with each of our clients, with the goal of taking your website off your plate so you can focus on the rest of your business. We use custom code for fast, high-performing websites and offer monthly plans that include ongoing support, edits, and performance tracking, so your site stays relevant and useful.</p>

                        <p class="cs-item-p">No. You can cancel anytime. There is no minimum or long-term contract. We earn your business month after month through results, not fine print.</p>

                        <p class="cs-item-p">We offer a 7-day grace period on all payments. After that, a $25 late fee is applied. If we don't hear from you within 14 days, your site may be temporarily suspended until the balance is paid. As long as you communicate with us, we'll be more than happy to work out a solution that doesn't involve any late fees.</p>

                        <p class="cs-item-p">Yes. Your domain is always yours, even if we purchased it on your behalf. If you cancel, we'll transfer it to your personal registrar account.</p>

                        <p class="cs-item-p">Edits can be requested by text, phone, or email. There's no portal, no tickets, and no waiting on hold. You speak directly with Liam, and changes are usually made within 12-48 hours depending on your plan. We try to keep communication as simple as possible so you can get the website updated without any headaches.</p>

                        <p class="cs-item-p">No hard limits. We ask that requests be reasonable (not a full redesign every week), but you can update images, text, services, pricing, hours, and more as often as needed. Additional pages may require you to move up to a different plan depending on your circumstances. For example, if you are on the starter plan and need to add a fourth page, we will upgrade you to the Growth plan.</p>

                        <p class="cs-item-p">Starter plans include a 24-48 hour turnaround. Growth plans are handled in 12-24 hours. Pro plan edits are typically completed in under 12 hours—often same day. More involved edits may take longer depending on their complexity.</p>
